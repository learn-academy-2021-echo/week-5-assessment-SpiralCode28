# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
A block in Ruby is where logic is placed, within a function. Most of the time you will see these blocks wrapped in curly braces. A block can be passed into methods.

Researched answer:
Similar to JavaScript, a block is an anonymous function. They are created with the keywords do/end or curly braces.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer:
A gem is a library of code which can be installed directly into your project. Many of these libraries are usually created by other developers to be used by anyone. One of the main locations where developers can find ruby gems is on the rubygems.org website.

Researched answer:
A gem can be installed with the tool, RubyGems or using the $gem in your console. You can also search for gems using the $gem search -r. Another great resource to use for finding a gem is The Ruby Toolbox. It helps you "find actively maintained & popular open source software libraries for Ruby programming language." - from the website. On the website you can search by categories, project popularity, and projects health. I will be using this and Rubygems.org in the future to find the right gem I'm looking for.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer:
Rails is a full-stack framework and comes with the tools you need to build applications. It includes the back & front end.f

Researched answer:
It follows an MVC (model, view, controller) architecture pattern - a way to divide up responsibility within an application. One of the main principles of Ruby on Rails is that it's an easier way of convention over configuration.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer:
A relational database is a database that stores data that relates to others types.

Researched answer:
They've been around for about 50 years and are the most widely accepted model for databases. They are best used for information needs in which data points that relate to the other and must be managed in a secure, consistent way. Some uses of RDBMS can be for tracking inventory, keeping track of large amounts of customer information, online shopping transactions, and many other ways. This is not the only type of database, yet this is the best one for maintaining timely consistency with large amounts of data and many users accessing the same data at the same time.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer:
Primary keys are unique identifiers in a column, meaning there is not a duplicate of that key. Most of the time, the primary key is a number. An example of this could be an ID number assigned to different consumers. These consumers could have the same name and it is easiest to verify which is which.

Researched answer:
To clarify, the primary key is a column in the table of information, which identifies the rows. In the case of a customer of an online store, the primary key would most likely be an ID number that accounts for all the information in the row. It is something like, customer's first name, last name, address, payment information, ect.
